Thank you for sharing the briefing on the Colruyt data export and the data delivered by Openthebox. Here's a summary and possible next steps based on the information provided:

Summary:
- Colruyt group currently provides a CSV file with about 25,000 companies, including VAT or KBO numbers.
- Openthebox will deliver a CSV this week containing standard export data fields for these companies.
- Each company's data will include:
  • 5-year history of turnover, profit, EBITDA, and equity (Eigen Vermogen)
  • Founding date
  • Health score indicating probability of default
  • Postal address
  • Branch locations (vestigingen)
  • Number of employees
  • Legal status (normal or bankruptcy)
  • Code 22 of annual accounts (Land and Buildings)
  • NACEBEL code (industry classification)
  • List of official publications links from the Government Gazette

Next steps you might consider:
- Prepare to receive and validate the Openthebox CSV data.
- Map and integrate these fields with your existing datasets for enriched company profiles.
- Use the health score and legal status for risk assessment and monitoring.
- Analyze historical financials (turnover, profit, EBITDA, equity) for trends and insights.
- Use geographical data (postal address, branches) for regional analysis.
- Consider how to regularly update and maintain this combined dataset over time.

If you need help with automated processing, data integration, analysis, or specific coding/scripts for this data, please let me know. I can assist with sample code, data pipeline suggestions, or analysis approaches.
